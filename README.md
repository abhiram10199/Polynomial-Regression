## Quadratic Polynomial Regression with Streamlit

### Goal
Develop a Python application using Streamlit to perform quadratic polynomial regression on manually entered data points.

### Todo Checklist

**Create a Streamlit Interface**
* Set up basic layout and components (input fields, buttons, chart display).

**Implement Data Input**
* Allow users to manually enter x and y values.
* Store entered data in a list or DataFrame.

**Perform Polynomial Regression**
* Calculate polynomial coefficients using the normal equations.

**Generate Predictions**
* Use the fitted model to predict y values for given x values.

**Visualize Results**
* Create a plot showing the original data points and the fitted polynomial curve.

### Milestones

1. **Basic Interface:** Create a Streamlit app with input fields for x and y.
2. **Data Storage:** Implement a mechanism to store entered data points.
3. **Polynomial Regression:** Write the function to calculate polynomial coefficients.
4. **Prediction:** Implement the function to predict y values.
5. **Visualization:** Create the plot to display the data and fitted curve.

### Additional Features (for later)

* **Linear and Cubic Regression:** Implement options to switch between different polynomial degrees.
* **CSV Upload:** Allow users to upload a CSV file containing data points.
* **Regularization:** Explore regularization techniques (L1, L2) to prevent overfitting.
* **Residual Analysis:** Calculate and visualize residuals to assess model fit.
