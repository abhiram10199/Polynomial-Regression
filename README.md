# Polynomial-Regression

Goal: Develop a Python application using Streamlit to perform quadratic polynomial regression on manually entered data points.

Todo Checklist
Create a Streamlit interface:
Set up basic layout and components (input fields, buttons, chart display).
Implement data input:
Allow users to manually enter x and y values.
Store entered data in a list or DataFrame.
Perform polynomial regression:
Calculate polynomial coefficients using the normal equations.
Generate predictions:
Use the fitted model to predict y values for given x values.
Visualize results:
Create a plot showing the original data points and the fitted polynomial curve.
Milestones
Basic interface: Create a Streamlit app with input fields for x and y.
Data storage: Implement a mechanism to store entered data points.
Polynomial regression: Write the function to calculate polynomial coefficients.
Prediction: Implement the function to predict y values.
Visualization: Create the plot to display the data and fitted curve.
Additional Features (for later)
Linear and cubic regression: Implement options to switch between different polynomial degrees.
CSV upload: Allow users to upload a CSV file containing data points.
Regularization: Explore regularization techniques (L1, L2) to prevent overfitting.
Residual analysis: Calculate and visualize residuals to assess model fit.
